# ColorsToNumbers

## Overview

**ColorsToNumbers** is an automation tool written in C# for analyzing, indexing, and reporting colored polygons in Adobe Illustrator files. The application scans all filled polygons, assigns a unique index to each color, labels each region, calculates area statistics, and exports high-quality PNG images and comprehensive PDF reports.

---

## Features

- **Automatic Color Indexing:** Scans all filled polygons and assigns a unique index to each distinct color.
- **Polygon Labeling:** Places index labels at the centroid of each polygon for clear identification.
- **Legend & Area Calculation:** Generates a color legend with area statistics for each color.
- **Batch Export:** Exports labeled artwork as high-resolution PNG images and compiles them into organized PDF reports.
- **Progress Feedback:** Provides real-time progress updates in the console for each processing stage.
- **Parallel Processing:** Utilizes parallelism for efficient handling of large and complex documents.

## Project Structure

- **ColorIndex:** Manages color-to-index mapping and color properties.
- **PolygonInfo:** Stores polygon geometry and its assigned color index.
- **ColorsToNumber2:** Main class for document processing, labeling, exporting, and reporting.

## Technologies & Innovations

- **.NET 8 & C# 12:** Utilizes the latest language features and performance improvements.
- **Adobe Illustrator COM Interop:** Automates Illustrator via its COM Interop.
- **NetTopologySuite:** Advanced geometry processing for accurate polygon analysis and manipulation.
- **PdfSharp:** High-quality PDF generation, including custom graphics and text rendering.
- **Parallel Programming:** Uses `Parallel.ForEach` and asynchronous tasks for fast, scalable processing.
- **Modern CLI Feedback:** Real-time console progress bars and status messages.
